✅ COMPLETED MODULES (Updated)
1. Database & Infrastructure
✅ PostgreSQL database provisioned (Neon)
✅ Drizzle ORM integrated
✅ Database tables: users, stores, ratings
✅ Auto-migration on server startup (server/migrate.ts)
✅ DbStorage class replacing MemStorage
✅ Form validations (Name: 20-60, Address: max 400, Password: 8-16 + uppercase + special char)

2. Backend API
✅ POST /api/signup - User registration
✅ POST /api/login - User login (normal users only)
✅ GET /api/users - List all users
✅ GET /api/users/:id - Get user by ID
✅ POST /api/users - Create user (admin)
✅ PUT /api/users/:id - Update user
✅ DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete user
✅ GET /api/stores - List all stores
✅ GET /api/stores/:id - Get store by ID
✅ POST /api/stores - Create store (admin)
✅ PUT /api/stores/:id - Update store
✅ DELETE /api/stores/:id - Delete store
✅ GET /api/stats - Dashboard statistics
✅ Password hashing with bcrypt

3. Frontend UI (All Pages Built)
✅ Login/Signup page with role-based routing
✅ Admin Dashboard (stats, user/store tables, add dialogs)
✅ User Dashboard (store listings, search, rating dialog)
✅ Store Dashboard (average rating, customer ratings table)
✅ Dark/Light theme toggle
✅ Reusable components (DataTable, StatsCard, StarRating, etc.)
✅ Form validations on frontend

❌ MISSING MODULES (What's Left)
1. RATINGS SYSTEM - CRITICAL 🔴
❌ No rating API endpoints at all:

POST /api/ratings - Submit rating
PUT /api/ratings/:id - Update rating
GET /api/stores/:id/ratings - Get store ratings
GET /api/users/:userId/ratings - Get user's ratings
❌ Storage methods missing in storage.ts:

submitRating()
updateRating()
getRatingsByStore()
getRatingsByUser()
getUserRatingForStore()
❌ Average rating calculation not implemented

❌ Frontend integration:

Rating submission calls console.log, not API
Can't fetch/display real ratings from database
2. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION 🔴
❌ No session management (express-session not configured)
❌ No authentication middleware
❌ No role-based access control
❌ Anyone can access /admin, /user, /store pages directly
❌ Logout functionality not implemented (button exists but does nothing)
❌ No user context/state management

3. STORE OWNER LOGIN 🔴
❌ Stores can't login - /api/login only checks users table
❌ Need unified login that checks both tables OR add stores to users table
❌ Store dashboard shows hardcoded store name, not logged-in store

4. PASSWORD UPDATE 🟡
❌ Password update endpoint missing (PUT /api/users/:id/password)
❌ Dialog exists but doesn't call backend
❌ No current password verification

5. MOCK DATA REMOVAL 🟡
❌ UserDashboard.tsx - Uses mockStores array (lines 11-16)
❌ StoreDashboard.tsx - Uses mockRatings array (lines 11-15)
❌ Need to replace with real API calls using useQuery

6. ADMIN FEATURES 🟡
❌ Edit user/store - Buttons exist but only console.log
❌ View user details page - Doesn't exist
❌ Store ratings not shown in admin stores table
❌ Edit dialogs not created
